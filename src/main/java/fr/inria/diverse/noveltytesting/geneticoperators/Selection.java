/**
 * for each population we use the selection operator to select interfaces that
 * have a novelty metric < a threshold and then we remove the remaining
 * interfaces
 * 
 * we use to save for each selection process the interfaces with a fitness value
 * below 1 in order to display at the end of the algorithm the list of
 * interfaces that have generated anomalies or incoherence in the outputs.
 * 
 * as well, we save the selected interfaces in a shared population called
 * Archive. In fact, the archive remembers past individuals that were highly
 * novel when they were first discovered (originated).
 * 
 * This is useful to calculate the novelty metric of each interface in the next
 * populations (see evaluation doc for more information about the novelty
 * metric)
