 * The first step in calculating the novelty of a new individual is to measure

 * individuals in the archive, reflecting how different it is from current
 * behaviors (the current population) as well as behaviors that were novel in
 * the past (the archive).
 * 
 * To do so, we calculate the novelty metric (behaviour) and we assign it to
 * each interface of the population to handle the selection process
